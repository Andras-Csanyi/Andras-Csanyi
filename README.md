### Hey!
I'm Andras Csanyi and below you find some info about me. I try to be sarcastic, but many times it sounds cynical. Sorry. :) 

When I have the freedom to choose tech stack to work with it is almost always .NET Core. I love it, I love the tooling and the innovation around it.
When I don't have the freedom to choose, because it is job and I have to use stuff has been used for long time, I'm kind of willing to work with any tech stack without any problem. It takes time to learn its quirks and accomodate its development experience, but that is fine.

#### Projects

##### [Encyclopedia Galactica](https://github.com/EncyclopediaGalactica)
As you can see below I'm a librarian (too) by education and this project is where library science and computer science meet.

### Contributions
Recently I suspended my contributions as my focus is learning computer science basics by my own, so I can be finally a **self-taught** developer.
You can find the articles about my learnings in my [blog](https://andrascsanyi.hashnode.dev).
Before I contributed to BlazorStrap project, as a job I maintained a few IBM Cloud SDK projects ([java](https://github.com/IBM/platform-services-java-sdk), [node](https://github.com/IBM/platform-services-node-sdk), [go](https://github.com/IBM/platform-services-go-sdk), [python](https://github.com/IBM/platform-services-python-sdk)).
